        title: "First all-wheel-drive rally car Five-cylinder turbo engine produced up to 591bhp Driven by rally stars like Walter Rohrl and Hannu Mikola This is the Michael Jordan of rally cars, ushering in a new era of all - wheel drive dominance that revolutionised the sport.Its sheer dominance over the RWD opposition on slippery surfaces helped the Quattro take 23 wins in six years as well as two drivers and two constructors championships in the process. It’s off-beat five-cylinder motor remains one of the greatest sounds in motorsport. You won’t find one for sale today but a modern RS3 Sportback offers a similarly beguiling five-cylinder soundtrack and that all-important Quattro layout.",

        title: "Last rear-wheel drive car to win the WRC 200 road-going models built for homologation purposes Allegedly Walter Rohrl's favourite rally car ever The Lancia 037 was the last rear-wheel-drive rally car to ever win the WRC. It was outclassed on the gravel and sand by the grippy Audi Quattro, but its mid- engined layout, lag - free supercharged engine and rear - wheel - drive balance gave it the edge everywhere else. It won constructors’ championship in 1983 and top three positions for three more years between 1984-1986.",

After a handful of entries and three wins in 1984, this little French rocketship took both the drivers’ and constructors’ championships in 1985 and 1986.",
