        make: 'Bugatti Chiron Super Sport',
        title: "Behold: the world's fastest production car. Yep, the go-faster Super Sport is based on the Bugatti Chiron that Andy Wallace piloted to 304.773mph back in 2019, and features an 8.0-litre quad-turbo V16 producing an extra 100bhp over the standard Chiron. All in, that’s 1,578bhp at your disposal.",

        title: "The Nevera is astonishingly fast. It has a 120kWh battery, four motors driving each wheel individually, and a power output equivalent to 1,914bhp and 1,740lb ft of torque, Mate Rimac’s hypercar is capable of 0-60mph in 1.85 seconds, 100mph in 4.3secs, and 186mph in 9.3secs – on to a 258mph max. Ah dammit, we’re even more lost for words…",

        make: 'Lamborghini Sián',
        title: "With a name derived from the Bolognese dialect for lightning bolt, it’s no surprise that electrification is the Sián’s talking point, too. It features a tuned version of the Aventador SVJ’s 6.5-litre, naturally aspirated V12, with another 34bhp of electrical oomph (courtesy of lithium-ion supercapacitors) added for a total of 808bhp. And while that electroboost may not sound a whole lot in the grand scheme of things, it helps to smooth out the savage gearshifts that have plagued Lambos since the Aventador.",
